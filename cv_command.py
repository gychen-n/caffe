# This script contains everything needed to run the person tracker on the TurtleBot.
# Before running on the commander machine, you need to setup a ROS catkin workspace
# on both the TurtleBot and the commander machine.  This script should be run from
# within that workspace.  See the following repo for help on getting ROS and the 
# TurtleBot set up: https://github.com/goromal/lab_turtlebot
# The repo for the image processing part of the project is located here:
# https://github.com/jakelarsen17/TurtleBot-Follow-Person
# The 'MobileNetSSD' files in the repo are needed to run and define a trained machine learning model 
# that can be used for a variety of object detection implementations. Here we use person detection.
